# Kata Supermarket

## The kata

In Jet Supermarket we have a checkout system that only can do one kind of offers, 
based on quantities of the same item (eg. 1 apple for 50 cents, 3 apples for 1.20 dollars).  
A the moment items are priced individually in cents (e.g. 1 apple costs 50 cents), 
while some items are multipriced: buy _x_ of them, and theyâ€™ll cost you _n_ cents.  

In fact the current prices are:  

|Item       | Unit Price  | Special Price |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| apple     | 50          | 3 for 130     |
| pear      | 30          | 2 for 45      |
| pineapple | 220         |               |
| banana    | 60          |               |


Our checkout accepts items in any order, so that if we scan a pear, a pineapple, 
and another pear, weâ€™ll recognize the two pear's and price them at 45 cents 
(for a total price so far of 265 cents).   
Because the pricing changes frequently, we pass in a set of pricing rules 
each time we start handling a checkout transaction.  

## Start small

Start making the system able to check individual price: discount will be calculated by hand by the cashier.  
Then start implementing offers.

### The 2<sup>nd</sup> User Story

### Add some more extra feature

Now, we think that having more items and offers will boost our earnings; so we are asking to:
* add these items:
  * mango -> 155 cents
  * coconut -> 233 cents
  * strawberry -> 120 cents
  * orange -> 45 cents
  * peach -> 40 cents

* implement a new offers system that lets us apply new pricing rules:
  * 3 x 2 offers (pay 2, get 3)
  * combo offers (eg. buy 3 apple and you will obtain an additional pear)
  
* implements the cash payment system
* implements the credit card payment system
  * the goverment stopped producing 1 and 2 cents coins; every bill/invoice has to be rounded to the nearest multiple of 5, even if paid with debet/credit card
  * we have to manage the cancellation of a product, because it is damaged or the customer decides to return it (e.g. it costs too much and he didn't realize it)

...[to be continued]...

PS: feel free to propose next change request to implement! ðŸ˜€

### An example of the Payment System User Story

```
As a cashier, 
I want to print the fiscal receipt for sold items
so I can collect money from my customers 
```
#### Acceptance Criteria

```
Scenario 1: customer buys items with and without applied offers

Background: 
* I checked out 3 apples for 130 cents instead of 150
* I checked out 2 pears for 45 cents instead of 60
* I checked out 2 pineapple for 440 cents (no offers for pineapples)

* When I close the checkout, a fiscal receipt like this is printed to the console:
```

| Item      | Price            |
|-----------|------------------|
| apple     | 50x3=~~150~~ 130 |
| pear      | 30x2=~~60~~ 45   |
| pineapple | 220x2=440        |
|           |                  |
| TOTAL     | 615              |
|           |                  |
| Goodbye!  |                  |


```
Scenario 2: an item is damaged then subtracted from the list

Background: 
* I scan 3 apples for 130 cents instead of 150
* I scan 2 pears for 45 cents instead of 60
* I scan 2 pineapple for 440 cents (no offers for pineapples)
* I refund 1 pear

* When I checkout, a fiscal receipt like this is printed to the console:
(NB: refund to be printed at the end of the receipt)
```

| Item      | Price            |
|-----------|------------------|
| apple     | 50x3=~~150~~ 130 |
| pear      | 30x2=~~60~~ 45   |
| pineapple | 220x2=440        |
| ~~pear~~  | ~~30x2=60 45~~   |
| pear      | 30x1=30          |
|           |                  |
| TOTAL     | 600              |
|           |                  |
| Goodbye!  |                  |

```
Scenario 3: automatic calculation of remainder

Background: 
* I checked out 1 pear for 30 cents

* I close the checkout
* I tell to the customer the total amount
* She gives me a 1 dollar bill
* I enter the received amout in the cash register

* I close the transaction, then a fiscal receipt like this is printed to the console:
```

| Item      | Price           |
