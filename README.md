## The kata

In Jet Supermarket we have a checkout system that only can do one kind of offers,
based on quantities of the same item (e.g. 1 apple for 50 cents, 3 apples for 1.30 dollars).  
At the moment items are priced individually in cents (e.g. 1 apple costs 50 cents),
while some items are multi-priced: buy _x_ of them, and theyâ€™ll cost you _n_ cents.

In fact the current prices are:

|Item       | Unit Price  | Special Price |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| apple     | 50          | 3 for 130     |
| pear      | 30          | 2 for 45      |
| pineapple | 220         |               |
| banana    | 60          |               |


Our checkout accepts items in any order, so that if we scan a pear, a pineapple,
and another pear, weâ€™ll recognize the two pear's and price them at 45 cents
(for a total price so far of 265 cents).   
Because the pricing changes frequently, we pass in a set of pricing rules
each time we start handling a checkout transaction.

## Start small

Start making the system able to check individual price: discount will be calculated by hand by the cashier.  
Then start implementing offers.

I want the cash register to calcultate the change  
so I can avoid silly mistakes with my customers during the payments 
```
#### Acceptance Criteria

```

  * E.g: If customer buys 1 apple (50 cents) and gives me a 1$ dollar note, the cash register will tell **on the display** 
    |   Total: 50  |
    |    Cash: 100 |
    |  Change: 50  |
```

### User Story: Payment by Credit Card

```
As a cashier, 
I want to let my customer pay by credit card 
```
#### Acceptance Criteria

```
* E.g: If customer buys 1 apple (50 cents), on checkout with a valid credit card, the cash register will show on the display: 
    |   0 - Transaction completed successfully |
```
#### Implementation notes
In this scenario, we have an external service that allows the supermarket to pay by credit card.  
This is an external service, we don't own it.  
Fortunately, there is an interface that allows us to know how to call it:

~~~csharp
namespace KataSupermarket;
/// <summary 
/// Credit Card Payment Service
/// </summary>
public interface IPaymentService
{
   /// <summary>   
   /// A cash register must connect to the service before accepting the payment.
   /// </summary>   
   /// <param name="username">The username assigned to the supermarket</param>    
   /// <param name="password">The password assigned to the supermarket</param>    
   /// <returns>Result</returns> 
   /// <example>0 - Connection completed successfully.</example>    
   /// <example>10 - Invalid username or password.</example>    
   /// <example>90 - Connection failed. Please try again later.</example>    
   Result Connect(string username, string password);
   /// <summary>     
   /// This method allows the supermarket to charge the <param name="creditCardNumber"></param> with the specified <param name="totalToPay"></param>.
   /// </summary>    
   /// <param name="creditCardNumber"></param>    
   /// <param name="totalToPay"></param>    
   /// <returns>Result</returns>    
   /// <example>0 - Transaction completed successfully.</example>    
   /// <example>1 - User not connected.</example>    
   /// <example>10 - Insufficient funds.</example>    
   /// <example>20 - Expired credit card.</example>    
   /// <example>30 - Lost or stolen credit card.</example>    
   /// <example>40 - Unusual activity.</example>    
   /// <example>90 - Connection failed. Please try again later.
   ///</example>    
   Result AcceptPayment(string creditCardNumber, int totalToPay);
}
/// <summary>
/// The result of an interaction with the Payment Service 
/// </summary>
public class Result
{
   /// <summary>    
   /// A code that identifies the interaction result.
   /// </summary>    
   public int StatusCode { get; }
   /// <summary>      A human readable message.
   /// </summary>    
   public string Message { get; }
    
   public Result(int statusCode, string message)
   {
        StatusCode = statusCode;
        Message = message;
   }
}
~~~
### Add some more extra feature

Now, the supermarket manager thinks that having more items and offers will boost his earnings; so he wants to:
* add these items:
  * mango -> 155 cents
  * coconut -> 233 cents
  * strawberry -> 120 cents
  * orange -> 45 cents
  * peach -> 40 cents

* implement a new offers system that lets us apply new pricing rules:
  * 3 x 2 offers (pay 2, get 3)
  * combo offers (e.g. buy 3 apple, and you will obtain an additional pear)

* implements the cash payment system
* implements the credit card payment system
  * the government stopped producing 1 and 2 cents coins; every bill/invoice has to be rounded to the nearest multiple of 5, even if paid with debet/credit card
  * we have to manage the cancellation of a product, because it is damaged or the customer decides to return it (e.g. it costs too much and he didn't realize it)

...[to be continued]...

PS: feel free to propose next change request to implement! ðŸ˜€
